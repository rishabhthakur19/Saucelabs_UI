# SauceLabsUITests

This repository contains automated UI tests for the Sauce Labs application using Python and Playwright. Below are the steps required to set up and execute these tests on a new system.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Python (>= 3.7) from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Ensure `pip` (Python package manager) is installed. It typically comes with Python.
3. Install Playwright:
   ```bash
   pip install playwright
   playwright install
   ```
4. Install Allure for generating test reports. Use the following command to install it globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g allure-commandline --save-dev
   ```
5. Install pytest-xdist for enabling parallel test execution:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest-xdist
   ```
6. Clone repo to your local
   ```

## Installation (I have used visual studio code as my editor)

1. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
2. Install all required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Discovering tests in the test explorer 
To ensure that the tests are discoverable in the test explorer do the following:
1. Ensure pytest is recognized in visual studio code 
   - Open the Command Palette in VS Code: Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (macOS).
   - Type Python: Select Interpreter and press Enter.
   - Select the interpreter where pytest is installed. 
   - If you're using a virtual environment, select the virtual environment's Python interpreter.

2. Ensure test framework is configured in VS Code 
   - Open Settings: Press Ctrl + , or go to File > Preferences > Settings.
   - Search for python.testing in the search bar.
   - Ensure these settings are correctly configured:
      - python.testing.pytestEnabled: Set to true.
      - python.testing.autoTestDiscoverOnSave: Set to true (this will trigger test  discovery whenever you save your test files).

## Running Tests

### Sequential Test Runs
To run the tests sequentially and generate Allure results:
```bash
python -m pytest -n auto --alluredir=allure-results
```

### Parallel Test Runs
To run the tests in parallel and generate Allure results:
```bash
python -m pytest -n auto --alluredir=allure-results
```

## Generating Allure Reports
After running the tests, generate the Allure report with:
```bash
allure generate --single-file allure-results --clean
```

This will create an `allure-report` directory with the report.

## Notes
- Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly as outlined above.
- Modify `config.py` in the `utils` directory to include your test-specific configurations.
- The tests are designed to work with the Sauce Labs application. Update the test files as needed for other applications or environments.
